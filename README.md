# Agility Toolkit

> A curated list of notable guides, methods, practices, techniques, tools and articles - relating to Agile, Product Management, User Experience

**Oath of Non-Allegiance**  
I believe there are no best ideas, instead, there are many good ideas. What works depends on the context. And it doesnâ€™t matter where ideas come from, if old-school stuff works then let us do it! Alistair Cockburn came up with the Oath of Non-Allegiance which I have signed:
