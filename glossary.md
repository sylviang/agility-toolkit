## Retrospective
**How to run a retrospective**: https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective  

There are many ways to conduct it, we can use digital tools such as trello.com, easyretro.io, miro.com or we can also use physical materials. If everyone is on-site, itâ€™s preferably to conduct the retro in-person commonly using post-its and markers. If you need such materials, can come get it from me. ðŸ˜€  More about retrospectives: https://www.funretrospectives.com/, https://reetro.io/retrospective-guide.html
